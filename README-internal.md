# Permissions

## Overview

1. Use GitHub Teams to manage the different iterations of SAC.
2. The repository is configured to give [Base permissions: None](https://github.com/organizations/scs-ugrad-deans-committee/settings/member_privileges) to every `scs-ugrad-deans-committee` member. Do not change this setting. This setting ensures that each member is powerless unless part of the current managing team.
3. The current managing team should be changed each year, see below.

## New committee

1. Create a [team](https://github.com/orgs/scs-ugrad-deans-committee/teams) for the current iteration of SAC if it doesn't already exist.
2. Add all the members of the current committee to the team.
3. Give the team [access](https://github.com/scs-ugrad-deans-committee/scs-ugrad-deans-committee.github.io/settings/access) to the website.
